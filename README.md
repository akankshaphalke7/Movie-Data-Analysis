# Movie-Data-Analysis
# Mini Project on Descriptive Analytics using File Handling

**Project Description**
This project focuses on implementing Descriptive Analytics using Python's File Handling capabilities. Descriptive Analytics involves summarizing and interpreting raw data to make it useful and meaningful. By leveraging file handling, this project reads data from various file formats (like CSV, TXT, or JSON), processes it, and provides insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.

The goal of this project is to showcase the ability to work with files programmatically, extract relevant data, perform basic analytics, and present results effectively.

**Features**

1.File Input and Output: Read data from files and save processed results to output files.
2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, filter unwanted data, and normalize the dataset for analysis.
3.Statistical Summary:
  Mean, Median, Mode
  Standard Deviation and Variance
  Minimum and Maximum values
4.Data Visualizations:
  Bar charts, Histograms, and Pie charts for better understanding of the dataset.
  Error Handling: Robust handling of file-related errors (e.g., file not found, incorrect format).
  Customizable Options: Ability to analyze data based on user-selected parameters.

**Technologies Used**

1.Programming Language: Python
2.Libraries:
  pandas for data manipulation
  matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
  os for file handling and operations

**Applications**

1.Gaining insights from structured data stored in files.
2.Preparing datasets for further advanced analytics or machine learning models.
3.Automating data summary and visualization tasks.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of combining Python programming with basic analytics concepts, making it a valuable learning resource for beginners.
